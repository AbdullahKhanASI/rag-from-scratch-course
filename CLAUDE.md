## Learning Outcomes

By completing this course, you'll understand:

- Core RAG architecture and components
- Document indexing and chunking strategies
- Vector similarity search and embeddings
- Query transformation and enhancement techniques
- Intelligent routing and classification
- Advanced retrieval methods (multi-query, fusion, decomposition)
- Re-ranking and result optimization
- Self-reflective and corrective RAG approaches
- Performance considerations for production systems

## Environment Setup

The course requires:
